# Assignment 4

The purpose of this assignment is to write a class library with a generic collection class that supports a set of numbers.

## Reading

Read through Chapter 12, 15, 16

## Instructions
- Create both a *class library* project and a unit test project. 
  - You may pick any reasonable name you want for the project, but unit test project should have a `.Tests` suffix (ie. <ProjectBeingTested>.Tests)
  - Projects should all target net5.
  - Ensure you enable nullable reference types, warnings as errors, and enabled .NET analyzers for both projects

- Write an `NumSet` class (not a record) with the following behavior
  - A constructor that accepts a variable number of integers (params array)
  - `ToString` method should display all of the numbers in the set.
  - `Equals`/`GetHashCode` implementation should be based on the integers within the NumSet. Because this is a set, the order of the items should not matter (ie. A set with (1, 2, 3) should equal a set with (3, 2, 1))
  - Add equality operators (`==` and `!=`) for NumSet
  - Add a method to return an array with the number from the set. Modifying the returned array should not change the `NumSet` in any way.
  - Use appropriate access modifiers for all members. Follow the principle of least access; if it doesn't need to be public use a different accessor.
  - All members should be fully unit tested

- Write a `SetWriter` class this class will be responsible for writing the set to a file.
  - This class should be in a *nested namespace*
  - This class should take in a file to write to in its constructor. In the constructor create a [StreamWriter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.streamwriter?view=net-5.0) instance to use to write the file.
  - This class should have a method that writes the values in the set to the file. 
  - This class should implement `IDispoable` following the [disposable pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose). Clean up the StreamWriter instance that was created in the constructor.
  - This class should be fully unit tested

## Extra Credit
- Write an implicit cast operator to converter `NumSet` a C# array. Ensure null cases are properly handled. This should also be unit tested.
- The process of constantly setting up your projects with duplicate properties can be simplified by using a [Directory.Build.props file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2019). Implement this in your pull request. Ensure that properties set in that file are not set within the project files.
